# Reinforcement Learning for Copter

A Improved version of a reinforcement learning copter
Uses either a Double DQN or a Dueling Double DQN
3 runs done, best progress when blocks turned off in the pygame environment
Ran for several days, more training and more exploration of hyperparameters would hopefully yield a better result
Can run for several thousand durations (selection of actions)
